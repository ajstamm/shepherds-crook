# An ending of sorts

This is the end of your story. After you part ways with your last keeper, close your eyes and sit in silence for five minutes contemplating your life and how you will be remembered. 

If you have not already done so, return to the [Key questions](https://astamm.gitbook.io/shepherd-s-crook/key-questions) and fill in any incomplete answers. 

_Recommendation: Write a quick description of your final staff below your drawing so that you can use it or legends about it in a future role playing game or story._
