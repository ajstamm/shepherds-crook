# An ending of sorts

This is the end of your story. When you have parted ways with your last keeper, close your eyes and sit in silence for five minutes contemplating your life. Then write some final thoughts on how you will be remembered. If you have not already done so, return to the [Key questions](https://astamm.gitbook.io/shepherd-s-crook/key-questions) and fill in any incomplete answers. Perhaps you will live on as an item or a legend in a future role playing game or story.
