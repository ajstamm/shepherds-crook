# Events

After describing each new keeper, select an event from the list provided. When you have completed one event, if you would like to explore your keeper further, feel free to return to the list to select a second or third event. 

As you resolve each event, your world or identity will change in some small way. You can:

* Add, remove, or change a trait. You should always have three to seven traits.
* Change your appearance somehow. Modify your drawing accordingly.
* Change some small thing about your world, environment, or reality.

_Recommendations: For any one keeper, each event type should be different. Select no more than three events per keeper. Do not select the same event type twice in a row. For any six events, include each event type at least once._

**Crisis**  
The crisis may be an internal or external threat. How does your keeper use you to resolve it? How are you affected by it? Choose from the list below or roll a D6 and select an element from the corresponding number.

1. Disaster: something natural, such as a flood or earthquake
2. Hunger: a food shortage from drought, flooding, spoiling, or mismanagement
3. Violence: war, a raiding party, or a predator
4. Unseen: something invisible, like a pathogen or a dangerous idea
5. Insidious: a new craze or a fast-spreading plant or animal species that threatens your flock
6. Threat: a challenge to your keeper's authority or necessity, such as a new shepherd, a rival for their position, or their protégé surpassing them

**Visitor**  
The visitor may be welcome, unexpected, or undesired. How does your keeper's meeting with them go? How do they interact with the community and how are you involved? Choose from the list below or roll a D6 and select an element from the corresponding number.

1. Vendor: an established trader or passing journeyman bringing news and goods, perhaps at a market
2. Entertainer: visiting performers, fortune tellers, or charlitans, perhaps at a festival or fair
3. Educator: a new teacher, scientist, or researcher, perhaps at an expo or new institute
4. Tourist: a traveler, authority, or friend from outside the community, or a wandering lost sheep, perhaps a tour group
5. Dissident: someone who threatens established authority or breaks community laws, expectations, or taboos
6. Seeker: a hiker, romantic, or other lost soul

**Pastoral care**  
Pastoral care is important for any shepherd and can take many forms. What are your and your keeper's roles in different aspects of pastoral care? How do you both feel about them? Are there specific traditions associated with them? Choose from the list below or roll a D6 and select an element from the corresponding number.

1. Births: including twins, stillbirths, infants with deformities, infertility
2. Deaths: from injury, disease, or childbirth; mercy killing
3. Illness: including cures, palliative care, superstition, and quarantine
4. Injury: including treatment and what to do when treatment fails
5. Mediation: including negotiation, conflict, domestic disputes
6. Mental health: of yourself, your keeper, or members of the community

**Observation**  
Sometimes, nothing of particular interest happens. Take some time to describe one aspect of your home or community. What are your and your keeper's roles in the community? How do you both feel about it? Choose from the list below or roll a D6 and select an element from the corresponding number.

1. Environment: habitat, community size, technological advancement
2. Home: where and with whom your keeper dwells
3. Duties: shepherding, leading, protecting
4. Politics: type of society, how leaders are selected, how laws are made and enforced
