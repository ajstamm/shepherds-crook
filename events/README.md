# Events

After describing each new keeper, select an event from the list provided. When you have completed one event, if you would like to explore your keeper further, feel free to return to the list to select a second or third event. 

Possible events include:

1. [Crisis](https://astamm.gitbook.io/shepherd-s-crook/events/crisis)
2. [Visitor](https://astamm.gitbook.io/shepherd-s-crook/events/visitor)
3. [Pastoral care](https://astamm.gitbook.io/shepherd-s-crook/events/pastoral-care)
4. [Observation](https://astamm.gitbook.io/shepherd-s-crook/events/observation)

As you resolve each event, your world or identity will change in some small way. You can:

* Add, remove, or change a trait. You should always have three to seven traits.
* Change your appearance somehow. Modify your drawing accordingly.
* Change some small thing about your world, environment, or reality.

_Recommendations: For any one keeper, each event type should be different. Select no more than three events per keeper. Do not select the same event type twice in a row. For any six events, include each event type at least once._
