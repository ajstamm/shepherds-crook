# Observation

Sometimes, nothing of particular interest happens. Take some time to describe one aspect of your home or community. What are your and your keeper's roles in the community? How do you both feel about it? 

Choose from the list below or roll a D6 and select an element from the corresponding number.

1. Environment: habitat, community size, technological advancement
2. Home: where and with whom your keeper dwells
3. Duties: shepherding, leading, protecting
4. Politics: type of society, how leaders are selected, how laws are made and enforced
5. Foods: the most and least popular, how agriculture and markets work, poisons and addictions
6. Arts: clothes, hobbies, entertainment, music
