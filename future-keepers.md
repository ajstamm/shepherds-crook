# Future keepers

Consider what your keeper was shepherding. People, sheep, cats, flying pigs, walking trees, or something else? Each keeper type includes a range of suggestions. At least one of the suggestions for each keeper type should be suitable for the type of staff you chose to be.

1. **Peasant** Your keeper came from humble beginnings. Perhaps they were a lowly shepherd, an acolyte at the village temple, or a servant or slave in a noble's manor. Were you a tool of their labor, a key to their salvation, or both?
2. **Noble** Your keeper was high-born. Perhaps they were a noble, royal, or well-placed military officer. Were you a badge of their rank or a tool of their punishment?
3. **Religious** Your keeper was a member of a religious order. Perhaps they were a lowly monk or nun toiling in the fields, or someone more highly placed, like an abbot or priestess. What purpose did you serve for them?
4. **Rogue** Your keeper lived outside the law. Perhaps they were an outlaw or thief outwitting their would-be captors, or a well-placed business owner or civil servant for whom the law did not apply. How did you help them evade capture?
5. **Hermit** Your keeper enjoyed solitude. Perhaps they lived on the edge of society, or in the wilderness, tending their flocks. Were they isolated by choice or did their profession or reputation require it?
6. **Healer** Your keeper served others. Perhaps they were a midwife, doctor, hedge witch, or apprentice. How were they regarded by their community?
7. **Visionary**

    Your keeper notices patterns and predicts the future. Perhaps they are a fortune teller, charlatan, scryer, or economist. Do they work to benefit the community or themselves?

8. **Magical creature**

    Your keeper is not human. Perhaps they are an imp, dryad, demon, or talking animal. Are they accepted, common, or reviled in the community?

9. **Academic**

    Your keeper values education. Perhaps they are a scientist, researcher, or teacher. Who does your keeper teach or assist? Are they part of a secret society or open academy?

10. **Collector**

    Your keeper likes collecting things. Perhaps they are a hoarder, museum curator, archivist, or antiquer. What do they collect? Do they share their collection with the community?

11. **Adventurer**

    Your keeper loves to travel. Perhaps they enjoy hiking, visiting friends and family, or exploring new places. How does their wanderlust affect their ability to tend their flock?

12. **Artist**

    Your keeper loves to create things. Perhaps they are a painter, musician, writer, or actor. How does their art integrate with their duties as a shepherd?
