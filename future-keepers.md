# Future keepers

Consider what your keeper was shepherding. People, sheep, cats, flying pigs, walking trees, or something else? Each keeper type includes a range of suggestions. At least one of the suggestions for each keeper type should be suitable for the type of staff you chose to be.

1. **Peasant** Your keeper came from humble beginnings. Perhaps they were a lowly shepherd, an acolyte at the village temple, or a servant or slave in a noble's manor. Were you a tool of their labor, a key to their salvation, or both?
2. **Noble** Your keeper was high-born. Perhaps they were a noble, royal, or well-placed military officer. Were you a badge of their rank or a tool of their punishment?
3. **Religious** Your keeper was a member of a religious order. Perhaps they were a lowly monk or nun toiling in the fields, or someone more highly placed, like an abbot or priestess. What purpose did you serve for them?
4. **Rogue** Your keeper lived outside the law. Perhaps they were an outlaw or thief outwitting their would-be captors, or a well-placed business owner or civil servant for whom the law did not apply. How did you help them evade capture?
5. **Hermit** Your keeper enjoyed solitude. Perhaps they lived on the edge of society, or in the wilderness, tending their flocks. Were they isolated by choice or did their profession or reputation require it?
6. **Healer** Your keeper served others. Perhaps they were a midwife, doctor, hedge witch, or apprentice. How were they regarded by their community?
