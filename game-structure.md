# Game structure

**Beginning**  
Describe your staff's origin story, creator, and first keeper \(if they are not your creator\).

**Chapters**  
Each chapter follows a separate keeper, described in this order. 

* Keeper: Describe who they are and how they acquired the staff.
* Event: Describe one to three notable events in which the staff and keeper were involved.
* Rest: Describe how the staff and keeper were parted, how the staff's time with the keeper changed it, and how long it waited for its next keeper.

_Recommendation: Write one keeper per sitting or day in as much or as little detail as you would like._

**Ending**  
Spend some time in quiet contemplation. Describe the staff's feelings and identity after its final keeper.
