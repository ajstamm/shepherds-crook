# Key concepts

**Staff**  
The object whose story you are telling. The staff cannot die, but may change as it passes from one keeper to another. You are the staff.

**Traits**  
Each new staff begins with three traits of your choosing. These traits may represent magical, physical, or personality attributes. Over time, these traits will evolve and change.

**Keeper**  
The staff's owner or wielder. The staff can only act through the keeper, not on its own. Each keeper represents a different chapter in the staff's story.

**Flock**  
That which your keeper shepherds. Your flock could refer to people, animals, sentient plants, animate objects, or whatever you would like. Your keeperâ€™s primary concern should be \(but may not be\) the health and welfare of their flock.

**Community**  
The larger group, town, or enclave to which your keeper belongs. It can be any size, structure, or composition that you would like.

**Rest**  
You can choose whether the staff passes directly from one keeper to another or whether, sometimes, it is set aside and rests until the next keeper comes along. How long it rests and how its new keeper obtains it are up to you.

**Change**  
Every time your staff passes to a new keeper, it changes in some way, perhaps due to the influence of the previous keeper or the way it was lost. These changes may be to the staff itself, to the staff's reality, or to its traits. At any time, you can make additional changes that are as large or small as you'd like.
