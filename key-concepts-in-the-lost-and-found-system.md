# Key concepts in the Lost and Found system

### Elements

These are the elements you need to know to play Shepherd's Crook.

**Staff**  
The object whose story you are telling. The staff cannot die, but may change as it passes from one keeper to another. You are the staff.

**Keeper**  
The staff's owner or wielder. The staff can only act through the wielder, not on its own. Each keeper represents a different chapter in the staff's story.

**Rest**  
You can choose whether the staff passes directly from one keeper to another or whether, sometimes, it is set aside and rests until the next keeper comes along. How long it rests and how its new weilder obtains it are up to you.

**Traits**  
Each new staff begins with three traits of your choosing, either from the list provided or your own creativity. These traits may represent magical, mundane, physical, or personality attributes. Over time, these traits will evolve and change.

**Change**  
Every time your staff passes to a new keeper, it changes in some way, perhaps due to the influence of the previous keeper or the manner in which it was lost. These changes may be to the staff itself, to the staff's reality or traits, or in response to periodic prompts. You can make additional changes at any time that are as large or small as you'd like.

### Game structure

This is the general flow of the game.

**Beginning**  
Describe your staff's origin story, creator, and first keeper \(if they are not your creator\).

**Chapters**  
Each chapter follows a separate keeper. 

_Recommendation: Write one keeper per sitting or day in as much or as little detail as you would like; the choice is yours._

* Keeper: Describe who they are and how they acquired the staff.
* Event: Describe one to three notable events in which the staff and keeper were involved.
* Rest: Describe how the staff and keeper were parted, how the staff's time with the keeper changed it, and how long it waited for your next keeper.

**Ending**  
Spend some time in quiet contemplation. Describe the staff's feelings and identity after its final keeper.
