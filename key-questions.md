# Key questions

Now that you have established where you came from, consider some other major elements of your story. You may not know the answers to these questions yet, so feel free to jot down a few notes and return to them at any time.

1. What are you called? Do you have a formal name or title?
2. What is your relationship with your keepers? Master/slave, mentor/student, hero/sidekick, worker/tool, familial, antagonistic, synergistic?
3. What place would you most like to return to? It this place physical, temporal, psychological? Conversely, what place do you most want to avoid? 
4. Describe an event in which you and a keeper were involved that later became a ballad, folktale, or parable. How you you feel about the story's evolution over time? What did it get right? What did it get wrong?
5. You and a keeper were involved in a love story. What role did your keeper play - lover, beloved, rival, officiant, obstacle? What was your part in the story?
6. As an immortal object, what do you find most baffling about your keepers' behaviors, values, and fears? If you could speak, what insight would you want to share with them, if anything?

After you have considered these questions, close your eyes and see yourself in your mind. For about a minute, or longer if you'd like, silently contemplate how your beginnings relate to the traits you selected. When you have finished contemplating, write down thoughts you would like to revisit and prepare to meet your first keeper.
