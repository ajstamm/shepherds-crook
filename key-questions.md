# Key questions

  
Consider these major elements of your story. You may not know the answers to these questions yet. Feel free to write a few notes and return to these questions at any time.

1. What are you called? Do you have a formal name or title?
2. What is your relationship with your keepers? Familial, antagonistic, synergistic? Master/slave, mentor/student, hero/sidekick? How does this relationship change over time?
3. What place would you most like to return to? It this place physical, temporal, psychological? Conversely, what place do you most want to avoid? 
4. Describe an event in which you and a keeper were involved that later became a common ballad, folktale, or other story. How do you feel about the story's evolution over time? What did it get right? What did it get wrong?
5. You and a keeper were involved in a love story. What role did your keeper play - lover, beloved, rival, officiant, obstacle? What was your part in the story?
6. As an immortal object, what do you find most baffling about your keepers' behaviors, values, and fears? If you could speak, what insight would you want to share with them, if anything?

Now close your eyes for about a minute, or longer if you'd like, and silently contemplate how your beginnings relate to the traits you selected. When you have finished contemplating, note thoughts you would like to revisit and prepare to begin your adventure with your first keeper.
