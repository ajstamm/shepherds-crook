# Preparing to play

### Set up

Before you start, you need:

* A quiet, peaceful place 
* At least 15 minutes per chapter
* Paper and implements to draw and write
* \(Optional\) A time keeper, such as a clock or timer
* \(Optional\) Some 6-sided and 20-sided dice

### Safety

As a solo activity, this game does not require you to negotiate boundaries and acceptable topics with others. However, you may find it helpful to consider your own boundaries. If, at any time, this game triggers feelings of discomfort or loneliness, stop and step away until you feel comfortable enough to continue. 

For example, you may find some topics in the [Events](https://astamm.gitbook.io/shepherd-s-crook/events) \(including death, illness, and disability\) disturbing or uncomfortable. If something does not work for you, feel free to change any portion of the game at any time.
