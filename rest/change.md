# Change

Each time you are parted from a keeper, your reality is changed in a large way. To represent this change, perform at least two of the following:

* Add, remove, or change a trait. Make sure you always have three to seven traits.
* Change your appearance. Modify your drawing accordingly.
* Change a major thing about your world, environment, or culture. Alternately, change a major perception you have about your world, environment, or culture.
