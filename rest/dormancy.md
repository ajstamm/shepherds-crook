# Dormancy

Decide how long you will be dormant between keepers and what that dormancy will look like. A few possibilities are listed below. 

* Will you be handed over immediately to a new keeper? If so, will your new keeper use you immediately or set you aside for days, weeks, or months?
* Will you be propped in a dusty corner and forgotten until you are needed again, years or decades later?
* Will you be lost or misplaced and found days or years or centuries later by happenstance?

Close your eyes and sit in silence for one to five minutes depending on the length of your dormancy.

_Recommendation: Take a break and do something else, or wait until tomorrow, before you return to the_ [_keeper list_](https://astamm.gitbook.io/shepherd-s-crook/future-keepers) _to select a new keeper._
