# Parting

After your final event with each keeper, describe how you were parted from them. 

_Recommendation: If you need ideas, choose from the list below or roll a D6 and select an element from the corresponding number._

1. Your keeper died and left you to a relative or protégé. Did you end up with the intended recipient?
2. Your keeper passed you on to someone else. Why did they give you away? Who did they give you to?
3. Your keeper sold you or auctioned you off. How did you feel about being sold? Did your keeper want to sell you?
4. You were stolen. Was the theft violent? Were you stolen by someone your keeper trusted?
5. You were lost. Were you traveling? Was your keeper careless? How were you found again?
6. You were placed in storage or catalogued and placed on display. Why were you set aside? How were you returned to service?
