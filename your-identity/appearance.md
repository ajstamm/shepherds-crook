# Appearance

You can choose from three types of staff in this game. Feel free to mix and match characteristics of these staffs to fit your preferred style or the story you want to tell. 

**Staff of office**  
You are a symbolic staff for rulers, prophets, and other religious, military, and community leaders.

**Staff of power**  
You are a magical staff for wizards, hedge witches, and others who practice magic.

**Staff of shepherding**  
You are a shepherd's crook used largely by herders, farmers, and others who tend livestock.

Draw your appearance. Be as silly or serious, simple or ornate, cartoonish or realistic as you would like. Consider whether you have been embellished with carvings, paint, jewels, beads, metal, or other adornments. 

_Recommendation: You need not draw well or spend much time on your illustration. If you prefer to begin with an image, download these_ [_suggested staff outlines_](https://github.com/ajstamm/writing/blob/main/shepherds_crook_staffs.png?raw=true)_. Feel free to add colors and descriptive notes as well._
