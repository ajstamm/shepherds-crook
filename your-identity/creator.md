# Creator

After you have described your appearance and traits, consider your origins.

1. Where were you made, carved, or decorated? A forge, forest, farm, or somewhere else?
2. Who created you? Are they well known for their craft? Were they commissioned? 
3. Did they intend to create you? Did you turn out the way they expected?
4. Why were you created? What was your creator's motivation? What was your intended purpose?
