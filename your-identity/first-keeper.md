# First keeper

Consider:

1. What does your keeper shepherd? People, sheep, cats, flying pigs, walking trees, animate books, or something else? 
2. Where does your keeper live? In a town, a commune, a cave? With family, roommates, pets, alone?
3. Is your creator your first keeper?

Choose your first keeper from the following list. Each keeper type includes a range of suggestions to cater to the different staff types. 

_Recommendation: If you are not sure what to choose, roll a D6 \(6-sided die\) and select the resulting number._ 

1. **Healer** Your keeper serves others. They may be a doctor, hedge witch, or apprentice. How are they regarded by their community?
2. **Hermit** Your keeper enjoys solitude. They may live on the edge of society or in the wilderness. Are they isolated by choice or does their profession or reputation require it?
3. **Noble** Your keeper is high-born. Perhaps they are a noble, royal, or well-placed military officer. Are you a symbol of their rank or of their punishment?
4. **Peasant** Your keeper came from humble beginnings. They may be a lowly shepherd, an acolyte at the village temple, or a servant or slave in a noble's manor. Are you a tool of their labor, a key to their salvation, or both?
5. **Religious** Your keeper is a member of a religious order. They may be a lowly monk toiling in the fields or a priestess overseeing a temple. What purpose do you serve for them?
6. **Rogue** Your keeper lives outside the law. They may be an outlaw or thief outwitting would-be captors or a well-placed business owner or civil servant for whom the law does not apply. How do you help \(or hinder\) them evading capture?
